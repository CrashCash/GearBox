# GearBox
Graphic simulation of a motorcycle transmission

To run this on your computer:
* Download and install the Java Runtime Environment from https://java.com/download/
* Download Java 3D from https://java3d.java.net/binary-builds.html and install as per the README-unzip.html file. This is rather a pain if you're using Windows.
* Download dist/GearBox.jar
* Run "java -jar GearBox.jar" in a DOS or xterm window.

And people wonder why Java 3D never took off... sheesh.
